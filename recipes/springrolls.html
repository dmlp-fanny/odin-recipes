        <h2>steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add pork, onion, salt and sugar to a small pot and add enough water
            to cover about 1 inch above the pork. Bring to a boil on high heat
            and then lower to medium and cook for about 25-30 minutes or until
            pork juices run clear when poked at the thickest part, or it
            registers 145 F with an instant read thermometer at the thickest
            part.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover the pork in a bowl as it cools so it doesn't darken. Once
            cool, slice the pork as thinly as you can to make rolling easier
            later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Defrost shrimp in water bowl. Once defrosted, de-vein the shrimp.
            Hold a shrimp up to a light to locate the vein, pierce the whiter
            part (joint) of the shrimp just below the vein with a toothpick, and
            pull the toothpick upwards towards the shrimp back. Do this slowly
            to remove the vein. Piece again at another joint if the vein breaks
            to remove all traces of vein. Repeat with all your shrimp.
          </li>
